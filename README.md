# 🔥 EchoLoop ($LOOP) – SocialFi Reinvented

**Your voice has value. Close the loop with $LOOP.**

## 🌐 Core Concept

A SocialFi engagement economy where your daily activity = real token rewards.
The more you connect, the more you earn.

## 💰 Rewards Engine

- **Daily Pool:** Fixed supply (e.g. 100k $LOOP) distributed each day
- **Distribution:** Proportional to engagement points earned
- **Scoring System:**
  - 👍 Like = 1 point
  - 💬 Reply = 3 points
  - 🔁 Repost = 5 points
  - 📝 Quote Repost = 6 points
  - 👥 New Follower = 2 points

## ⚡ Boost Multipliers (Staking $LOOP)

- 🥉 **Bronze** (1k staked) → +10% points
- 🥈 **Silver** (10k staked) → +25% points
- 🥇 **Gold** (100k staked) → +50% points

Staking = more influence + bigger rewards.

## 🔄 Tokenomics & Funding

- Buy/Sell Tax → fuels treasury
- Treasury → funds daily rewards & deflationary burns
- Sustainable loop: Engage → Earn → Stake → Grow
